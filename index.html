                                <p>I have worked at SEGA of America for a few years now. In addition to my regular role, I have led
                                    daily stand-ups for the past couple of years and, recently been put in charge of creating work back
                                    schedules for all web projects. I also work with the Data Protection Officer and, am in charge of
                                    making sure all of our sites are GDPR and CCPA compliant.</p>
                                <p>I am always up for any challenge be it code-based, learning how to use a new API or service or, in brain storming ways to go about achieving what
                                    needs to be done. I have written the age gate code used across all of our Mature rated websites and, evolved that to the latest iteration as can
                                    be seen on the Persona 5 Strikers website. By age-gating specific elements rather than the whole page as we had previously been doing; I was able
                                    to help reduce our workload as we were having to make microsites for marketing purposes.
                                </p>
                                <p>I have also integrated Mailchimp into our websites and, left the code thoroughly commented to make reuse easier. I reworked the way language changes were handled on
                                    our pages which involved changing the code from PHP, which wasn't consistently working, to using Ajax and JSON as we support five languages and eight countries.</p>
                                <p>I have been coding React applications as well. For each of these, I start by coding with React using component state and props. From there, I then recode them using React with Redux, React with hooks and, React with Context. </p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">Created a website for a salon owner that was going into business for herself. The goal of the site was to allow her clients to quickly and easily book
                                        their appointments so she would not constantly be on her phone making the appointments herself. </p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">I created the logo and style of the website based on her vision months before the Salon was to open and, was able to have her site live on the day
                                        she needed it to be by quickly changing out the pictures and updating the google map. Along with creating the site, I researched and presented several
                                        services that provide booking software. </p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">The site was created using HTML5 and, a combination of CSS3 along with Bootstrap to style and make the page responsive. jQuery and JavaScript were also
                                        used to add in some other functionality.</p>

                                        end that dealt with the database. To help simulate a work environment, we also had a senior developer that acted as our
                                        product manager. We met with him once a week to discuss our progress and, receive suggestions on how to improve what we were
                                        doing. We also met near daily with a mid-level developer to do stand ups as well as make sure we were on track to complete our
                                        weekly sprints. </p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">The site was designed to help perspective students find colleges based on several filters. The colleges are initially populated by
                                        using location and major. From there further filters such as type of school, degrees offered and tuition type could further filter
                                        down the schools. The map populates based on bounds and will auto populate as the map is dragged around. Each individual school can
                                        also be clicked on to see more in-depth information.</p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">The site was built on the front end using React, Redux, and JavaScript with ES6. Though this was not the best choice for this
                                        kind of site, we used these frameworks because it was what we were learning and; we were looking to solidify our knowledge. The
                                        back end used Apache, PHP and MariaDB.</p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">Coded this website based off a design created by James Ferrell, a member of the SEGA creative services team. Most of the game page websites
                                        go through different versions of the site, this one had three over the course of it's lifecycle, a splash page at the game announcement, a teaser page and then this final site.
                                        Along with this, there are always minor updates that usually involve adding trailers or changing up text from pre launch to post launch.
                                        This particular site I wanted to highlight because it shows how I was able to handle the large number of SKUs due to the amount of consoles the game was coming to and, the number
                                        of editions for the game. Along with this, because the game itself takes place over the course of two decades, I was tasked with showing a couple of the characters at the two main
                                        time frames within the game.

                                    going back and forth with Microsoft and Sony to meet their brand guidelines. This information changed many times over the course of a couple
                                    of months which meant alot of fixes along the way.

                                    the code was working as well however, it was rather complicated. So rather than move forward with it, I thought there must be
                                    a much less complex way of doing so. I started over and, accomplished my goal by reducing my original 10 pieces of state to just 4.</p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">Due to the number of games launching each year, my team has been tasked with creating a more templated
                                        website structure that can help cut down the development time of websites. The template has been designed by Ben Schilling after many rounds of
                                        feedback. So I used that template structure to design the site as well as match the style of the franchise. I am showing off this
                                        site because it is the first of what we are trying to shift to with future sites and, the code was written by myself.

                                    <p class="alignLeft">The age gate was completely revamped for this site. For the past couple of years we had been using an
                                    age gate with an input for month, day and year. Here I am using a select field and, for both the day and year bringing in the options
                                    dynamically through JavaScript. This is the first Mature rated site where the content
                                    of the page is immediately available. Upon clicking a trailer or image, you are then required to enter your age to see more. One of
                                    the reasons we chose to do this is that we have had additional requests to make microsites in order to bypass the need of an age gate. So by creating an age gate on just what is required, it allows the information that would otherwise end up on the microsite to be available immediately. </p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">Please note, I have left this application up but, currently the Yelp API is failing and, need to get it fixed.</p>
                                     <p class="alignLeft">This was a group project that was done on a tight schedule of a day and a half. With a group of four, we were tasked to create
                                        a site using at least three API’s. The result of that was our Grab A Beer application.</p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">The idea is that based on the type of beer a person is interested in having, a map is populated that has all the restaurants
                                        around either their given location or an area the user is interested in going to that serves that type of beer. A small list of
                                        beer types was created and, we used the choice made to make a call to yelp. The call to yelp takes in the location and beer type
                                        and matches it up to places that match. From their, the coordinates and other information such as address and website of those
                                        locations are then used to create the markers and info windows on the map. We also made a call to a beer API that gives information
                                        back about beers. We used that for food pairings.</p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">My contributions surrounded Google Maps. I created the map and populated it with markers and the info windows. I also dealt with
                                        geolocation, geocoding and, creating the directions from the current location to the chosen restaurant. </p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games is likely the most prolific website I have worked on. More people have visited this
                                        site than all the other sites I have worked on combined. It is one thing to get the opportunity to work with SEGA but, to throw
                                        in Nintendo as well made this a very special project for me. I designed the site to make the party-game aspect stand out. Each
                                        event when hovered on plays a small repeating MP4, I used animated stars in the background and, animated the Nintendo Switch controllers just
                                        to add in some fun to the site.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="alignLeft">Ultimately this was a huge global announcement that tied in to the E3Expo. This project supported far more countries than
                                    we had ever handled. I wrote a JavaScript Constructor to route visitors to the correct page as Nintendo was supporting many countries and,
                                    I needed to be able to push people to the correct website based on where they were located. In order to achieve this, I wrote the code to first try
                                    to get the browser language. If this failed, I called an API that would allow the location of the country to be found. I did it in this
                                        order to save the cost of calling an API for every visit. In order to remain GDPR compliant I specifically called for just the country location.
                                        With the country location at hand, I was able to then create the URL based off of six different arrays that held country codes. Based on the array
                                        this would allow me to know what type of URL had to be built.</p>
                                    <p class="alignLeft">Another of the big challenges of this site is the overall number of videos. Even though they are small it caused an enormous issue. My end solve for
                                    this was to lazy load the videos after the site came up. On a desktop this works well. </p>
                                    <p class="alignLeft">I can not directly share the code for the site as it is a title that was done for work and, not my own personal project.
                                        However, the site was done using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript and JQuery. As aforementioned, I used an API for finding out a users country if necessary.
                                        This was not my choice but, I had to also create individual pages for every language we supported. Typically we would
                                        use a JSON file or JavaScript object and change the text through Ajax or JavaScript. I am also the lead for GDPR and CCPA compliance and use CIVIC cookie
                                        to aid in that. Finally, the site is using Google Analytics.

                                    <p class="alignLeft">One Piece Battle Match is a spin off of the classic memory match game. As a player, you still make matches but, you are battling
                                        a computer based opponent that can damage you as well. You don’t always have to make all the matches to actually defeat your
                                        opponent but, it is the main purpose of the game. The game allows you to chose your hero based on several of the Straw Hat crew member and, each character has their own set of cards depicting their fighting styles with unique actions based on their actual fighting styles.</p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">Each turn you flip two cards and, if they match the action on the card occurs. If no match is made, a story unfolds in the middle
                                        of the screen. Following your turn, the villain takes his action which is shown within the same story window. Some times damage
                                        is dealt, other times, it is just flavor text to add to add to the overall theme. </p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">The code is a combination of HTML5, CSS3, jQuery and JavaScript. The health bars and, one of the modals were developed from
                                        Bootstrap. The javaScript is written in a procedural format as this was written in our second week of the program and, we
                                        were still in the process of learning the basics. </p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">Created a weather app that gives weather data based on a users input of a zipcode. The weather is displayed to give hourly
                                        results as well as daily results. The days can be clicked to give more specific information for the given day.</p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">This application was created using React. I created this four different ways so though the application looks the same
                                        the code is different. I first created this using component state and passing props down to children. I then
                                        rewrote the application using React and Redux, then React with hooks and finally React with Context.</p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">To make this a bit more complex, I also called two different APIs. First I use Google Geocoding API to take the zipcode
                                    and get the latitude and longitude. If this information comes back successfully, the second API, OpenWeather is called
                                    to get the weather information. If the zipcode is bad, a warning message is given instead and doesn't call for the weather.
                                        Along with this, I am using react-router-dom and createHashHistory to route the project based on checking a specific days weather.</p>

                                        didn’t always have access to his TARDIS and sonic screwdriver? In fact for some time he drove around
                                        in a now classic yellow car named Bessie. The history of Doctor Who and, how
                                        it evolved to become what it is today is a fascinating journey. </p>

                                        site covers all of the incarnations of the Doctor through David Capaldi, as well as his companions. This includes each version of the
                                        Doctors initial and final appearance, first and last lines as well as what the cause of his regeneration was. As
                                        for the companions, there is information covering each of their first and last appearances and how they ended
                                        up departing the Doctor.</p>

                                        for infinite play. The game lights up, flashes when you lose and, the counter was designed to appear to give
                                        a little glow along with a digital font. Through use of shadowing, the game buttons appear to have depth and,
                                        each has its own unique sound.</p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">The game was created using HTML5 and CSS3. The functionality was done with jQuery and JavaScript. The audio used JavaScripts

The main content is further broken down to the colored background area and, the descriptive area underneath.

                                    <p class="alignLeft">The color in the background is also random and, comes from faker.js. Because this gave a wide spectrum of colors, I created a check to make sure light colors that wouldn't allow the white text to be legible to be caught and changed.</p>

                                    their online training due to Covid-19. So a carousel section was created which was meant to show off videos of classes but, ended up being used for images.</p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">The original website was built using Wix. Some of what was being requested wasn't possible in the Wix platform so I
                                        started from scratch in building the website. I integrated the previous design but updated it to better be responsive and, to do things
                                        that Wix would not allow. I used HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery, PHP and the Google Maps API. PHP was used with the contact
                                    form and deal with making sure that anything entered into the form would be safe.</p>
