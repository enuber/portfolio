                                <p>I worked at SEGA from mid-2017 until April 2024, beginning as a contract employee and eventually managing the web team. Despite the team consisting of just three members, we accomplished a remarkable amount of work as the number of titles released grew each year, with  roles expanding including into CRM. I operated with the efficiency and speed typical of an agency, often juggling two to three projects while managing all of the often daily unexpected requests. As a team manager, I also ran stand-ups, created work-back schedules, assigned projects, and collaborated with various teams to discuss upcoming web projects and campaign expectations. Despite the overwhelming demands, I consistently completed my projects on time, if not early.</p>
                                <p>As a team player, I was always ready to support both the web and design teams, offering help whenever needed. I collaborated with all levels of management and communicated with external partners, including Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, the International Olympic Committee, Blue Planet Software, and others. My role also involved working with other SEGA divisions, such as SEGA of Europe and the Sonic team.
                                </p>
                                <p>Beyond my work on numerous websites, I contributed to several key initiatives. I helped develop a template to streamline site development, designed and coded a universal toolbar now featured across most SEGA and Atlus sites, and created a Webpack bundler to support the latest JavaScript, SCSS, and CSS files. Additionally, I worked closely with the Data Protection Officer to ensure GDPR and CCPA compliance, introduced A/B testing for performance improvements, and built high-traffic sites for popular titles featuring Sonic, Mario, and Tetris.</p>
                                <p>Since then, I have transitioned to freelance work while expanding my skill set. My passion for coding, continues to drive me forward, and I remain committed to continuous learning through online courses and staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the field.</p>

                                        I designed and implemented a comprehensive mega menu aimed at enhancing cross-site navigation. The primary objective was to make it easier for users to discover additional games and explore new content across various SEGA sites. By carefully organizing the structure and layout of the menu, I ensured that it could prominently feature sales, promotions, and announcements of new titles, thereby increasing user engagement with current and upcoming releases.</p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">In addition to improving navigation, I integrated marketing email sign-up forms directly into the toolbar. This strategic placement significantly boosted conversion opportunities by allowing users to easily subscribe to updates and promotions while browsing. The mega menu was developed with versatility in mind, making it simple to integrate into any HTML page. I also focused on ensuring that the menu was easy to maintain and update, which helped streamline ongoing management and allowed for quick adjustments in response to new content or marketing needs. Was able to be adapted for kid friendly and mature sites as well by simply changing a boolean data-attribute.</p>

The application was built with a focus on reducing the need for extensive manual coding, making it accessible for users with varying levels of technical expertise. This approach not only streamlined the initial setup of sign-up forms but also allowed for easy revisions and maintenance, ensuring that the forms could be quickly updated or modified to align with new marketing strategies or changes in design.

                                        I designed and coded a multi-page website with a focus on enhancing user engagement and creating a seamless browsing experience. One of the standout features is the characters page, where I implemented dynamic content swapping rather than directing users to new pages. This approach was intentionally chosen to keep users engaged by preventing the disruption of constant page reloads as they explore different characters. The materials on the page update in real-time as users interact with the interface, maintaining a fluid and interactive experience.

                                        On the gameplay page, I introduced a unique functionality where clicking the button at the bottom of the section returns the user to the top of the content area while seamlessly transitioning to the next section without reloading the page. This feature ensures continuity in user interaction, providing a smooth and uninterrupted flow as they navigate through the gameplay information.

                                        For the products page, I opted for styled dropdown menus instead of the default HTML dropdowns. These customized menus not only improved the visual appeal of the page but also enhanced user experience by offering a more intuitive and aesthetically pleasing way to browse through product options. The design choices across these pages were driven by a desire to create a more immersive and engaging user experience, minimizing disruptions and keeping users focused on the content.

                                    <p class="alignLeft">I created this four different ways so though the application looks the same the code is different. I first created this using component state and passing props. I then rewrote the application using React and Redux, followed by React with hooks and finally React with Context.</p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">In my Git repository, you'll also find an earlier version of the calculator code, labeled as calculator_old. Although this version was functional, it was overly complex, utilizing 10 pieces of state. Recognizing the unnecessary complexity, I decided to start over and successfully reduced the state management to just 4 pieces of state, achieving the same functionality with a much cleaner and more efficient codebase.</p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">With the growing number of game launches each year, my team was tasked with developing a more templated website structure to streamline the creation of game-specific sites and reduce overall development time. The finalized template, went through several rounds of feedback, and served as the foundation for the site's structure. I adapted this template to match the unique style of the franchise, and this site represents the first step that was the transition to this new approach, with all the code written by me.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="alignLeft">For this site, I completely revamped the age gate. Previously, we used an age gate that required users to input their month, day, and year of birth manually. In this new version, I implemented select fields for both day and year, dynamically generating the options with JavaScript. This is also the first Mature-rated site where the main content is accessible immediately, with age verification only required for specific actions like viewing trailers or images. This approach was chosen to eliminate the need for microsites, as it allows immediate access to general content while restricting only what is necessary.</p>
                                    <p class="alignLeft">Additionally, the purchase section was designed to be easily adaptable, allowing for quick adjustments based on the game's release platforms and available editions. To enhance the user experience, I also created a lazy loader for character images, which loads them after the page has finished loading, significantly reducing the site's initial load time.</p>

                                     <p class="alignLeft">This was a group project that was done on a tight schedule of a day and a half. With a group of four, we were tasked to create
                                        a site using at least three API’s. The result of that was our Grab A Beer application.</p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">The idea is that based on the type of beer a person is interested in having, a map is populated that has all the restaurants
                                        around either their given location or an area the user is interested in going to that serves that type of beer. A small list of
                                        beer types was created and, we used the choice made to make a call to yelp. The call to yelp takes in the location and beer type
                                        and matches it up to places that match. From their, the coordinates and other information such as address and website of those
                                        locations are then used to create the markers and info windows on the map. We also made a call to a beer API that gives information
                                        back about beers. We used that for food pairings.</p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">My contributions surrounded Google Maps. I created the map and populated it with markers and the info windows. I also dealt with
                                        geolocation, geocoding and, creating the directions from the current location to the chosen restaurant. </p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games is likely the most prolific website I have worked on. More people have visited this
                                        site than all the other sites I have worked on combined. It is one thing to get the opportunity to work with SEGA but, to throw
                                        in Nintendo as well made this a very special project for me. I designed the site to make the party-game aspect stand out. Each
                                        event when hovered on plays a small repeating MP4, I used animated stars in the background and, animated the Nintendo Switch controllers just
                                        to add in some fun to the site.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="alignLeft">Ultimately this was a huge global announcement that tied in to the E3Expo. This project supported far more countries than
                                    we had ever handled. I wrote a JavaScript Constructor to route visitors to the correct page as Nintendo was supporting many countries and,
                                    I needed to be able to push people to the correct website based on where they were located. In order to achieve this, I wrote the code to first try
                                    to get the browser language. If this failed, I called an API that would allow the location of the country to be found. I did it in this
                                        order to save the cost of calling an API for every visit. In order to remain GDPR compliant I specifically called for just the country location.
                                        With the country location at hand, I was able to then create the URL based off of six different arrays that held country codes. Based on the array
                                        this would allow me to know what type of URL had to be built.</p>
                                    <p class="alignLeft">Another of the big challenges of this site is the overall number of videos. Even though they are small it caused an enormous issue. My end solve for
                                    this was to lazy load the videos after the site came up. On a desktop this works well. </p>
                                    <p class="alignLeft">I can not directly share the code for the site as it is a title that was done for work and, not my own personal project.
                                        However, the site was done using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript and JQuery. As aforementioned, I used an API for finding out a users country if necessary.
                                        This was not my choice but, I had to also create individual pages for every language we supported. Typically we would
                                        use a JSON file or JavaScript object and change the text through Ajax or JavaScript. I am also the lead for GDPR and CCPA compliance and use CIVIC cookie
                                        to aid in that. Finally, the site is using Google Analytics.

                                    <p class="alignLeft">One Piece Battle Match is a spin off of the classic memory match game. As a player, you still make matches but, you are battling
                                        a computer based opponent that can damage you as well. You don’t always have to make all the matches to actually defeat your
                                        opponent but, it is the main purpose of the game. The game allows you to chose your hero based on several of the Straw Hat crew member and, each character has their own set of cards depicting their fighting styles with unique actions based on their actual fighting styles.</p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">Each turn you flip two cards and, if they match the action on the card occurs. If no match is made, a story unfolds in the middle
                                        of the screen. Following your turn, the villain takes his action which is shown within the same story window. Some times damage
                                        is dealt, other times, it is just flavor text to add to add to the overall theme. </p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">The code is a combination of HTML5, CSS3, jQuery and JavaScript. The health bars and, one of the modals were developed from
                                        Bootstrap. The javaScript is written in a procedural format as this was written in our second week of the program and, we
                                        were still in the process of learning the basics. </p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">Created a weather app that gives weather data based on a users input of a zipcode. The weather is displayed to give hourly
                                        results as well as daily results. The days can be clicked to give more specific information for the given day.</p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">This application was created using React. I created this four different ways so though the application looks the same
                                        the code is different. I first created this using component state and passing props down to children. I then
                                        rewrote the application using React and Redux, then React with hooks and finally React with Context.</p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">To make this a bit more complex, I also called two different APIs. First I use Google Geocoding API to take the zipcode
                                    and get the latitude and longitude. If this information comes back successfully, the second API, OpenWeather is called
                                    to get the weather information. If the zipcode is bad, a warning message is given instead and doesn't call for the weather.
                                        Along with this, I am using react-router-dom and createHashHistory to route the project based on checking a specific days weather.</p>

                                        didn’t always have access to his TARDIS and sonic screwdriver? In fact for some time he drove around
                                        in a now classic yellow car named Bessie. The history of Doctor Who and, how
                                        it evolved to become what it is today is a fascinating journey. </p>

                                        site covers all of the incarnations of the Doctor through David Capaldi, as well as his companions. This includes each version of the
                                        Doctors initial and final appearance, first and last lines as well as what the cause of his regeneration was. As
                                        for the companions, there is information covering each of their first and last appearances and how they ended
                                        up departing the Doctor.</p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">A recreation of the Simon electronic game originally released by Milton Bradley in 1978. The game allows
                                        for infinite play. The game lights up, flashes when you lose and, the counter was designed to appear to give
                                        a little glow along with a digital font. Through use of shadowing, the game buttons appear to have depth and,
                                        each has its own unique sound.</p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">The game was created using HTML5 and CSS3. The functionality was done with jQuery and JavaScript. The audio used JavaScripts
                                        built in oscillator, gain and frequency to create the pitches for the sound. </p>

Before the call is made, a randomly generated number is used to determine how much data should be retrieved.</p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">The card itself is broken down into the header area and then the main content area found underneath. The main content is further broken down to the colored background area and, the descriptive area underneath. By doing so, I have made smaller components that could easily be reused, adjusted and maintained.</p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">The color in the background is also random and, comes from faker.js. Because this gave a wide spectrum of colors, I created a check to make sure light colors that wouldn't allow the white text to be legible to be caught and changed.</p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">Created a website for a local gym owner. The goal of the site was to share pertinent information and, reducing the
                                    number of ways that the original site had to have clients connect with them. One of the suggestions I had was to showcase
                                    their online training due to Covid-19. So a carousel section was created which was meant to show off videos of classes but, ended up being used for images.</p>

                                    <p class="alignLeft">The original website was built using Wix. Some of what was being requested wasn't possible in the Wix platform so I
                                        started from scratch in building the website. I integrated the previous design but updated it to better be responsive and, to do things
                                        that Wix would not allow. I used HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery, PHP and the Google Maps API. PHP was used with the contact
                                    form and deal with making sure that anything entered into the form would be safe.</p>
